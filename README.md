# Well-formed website

The code for https://www.well-formed.co.uk

The `public/` directory should be used for the website.

## Running locally

In theory we've set up MAMP and `/etc/hosts` on my laptop to run this as
http://www.well-formed.test


## Running in production

Despite the below, the site on lynx isn't a git repository, so we're just SFTPing
updates to the site.



On the Mythic Beasts server, we then just do a git pull to fetch the complete set
of files required.
