# Well-formed website

The code for https://www.well-formed.co.uk

All in git, not currently on GitHub. Files are manually copied to the website using FTP.

The `public/` directory should be used for the website.

## Running locally

In theory we've set up MAMP and `/etc/hosts` on my laptop to run this as
http://www.well-formed.test


## Running in production

On the Mythic Beasts server, we then just do a git pull to fetch the complete set
of files required.
