<div class="bodytext">
	<p>Well-Formed was founded by <a href="https://www.gyford.com/">Phil Gyford</a> who has been designing and building things on the internet since the mid-1990s. He has previously held positions at <cite>Wired</cite> magazine, BERG, and Capital Radio.</p>

	<p>Phil has over 25 yearsâ€™ experience of front- and back-end development, and has a good eye for design and usability; the user, not the code, comes first.</p>

	<p>We are flexible in the technologies we use, choosing whatever makes most sense for the scale and type of project, and the experience of the users. For example:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>, sometimes with <a href="https://wagtail.org">Wagtail</a>, for larger, database-backed sites.</li>
		<li><a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> for blog-like sites that require less bespoke back-end work.</li>
		<li>Simple PHP for small sites that require only a dash of back-end flexibility.</li>
		<li><a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a> for creating custom, dynamic visualisations of data.</li>
		<li>All using good Sass/CSS and as much or as little JavaScript as required.</li>
	</ul>
