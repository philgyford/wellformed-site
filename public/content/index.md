Well-Formed makes interesting websites, which often fall into these two broad&nbsp;categories:

* **Making data visible**  
  If youâ€™ve got lots of data that could be more visible and usable, we can get it online in a simple, clear website that's easy to explore and&nbsp;share.

* **Building prototypes**  
  Whether you call it a prototype, an Alpha, R&D, or something else, we can help you get a first-version of your website or online service up and&nbsp;running.

We like websites that are simple and fast, that are built around usability and data, and that do good things on and for the web.

If you have an interesting project we could help with, [do&nbsp;get&nbsp;in&nbsp;touch](mailto:contact@well-formed.co.uk).
