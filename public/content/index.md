Well-Formed makes interesting websites, which often fall into these two broad&nbsp;categories:

* **Making data visible**  
  If youâ€™ve got lots of data that could be more visible and usable, we can get it online in a simple, clear website that's easy to explore and share.

* **Building prototypes**  
  Whether you call it a prototype, an Alpha, R&D, or something else, I can help you get a first-version of your website or online service up and running.

Of course, if you have an unusual and worthwhile project that doesn't fit these descriptions, do still [get in touch](mailto:contact@well-formed.co.uk).

I can handle both front- and back-end development, with a good eye for design and usability. When one is right for the task, I often use Django or WordPress on the back-end. I write sensible HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and enjoy visualising data with tools like D3.js.
