Well-Formed was founded by [Phil Gyford](https://www.gyford.com/) who has been designing and building things on the internet since the mid-1990s. He has previously held positions at <cite>Wired</cite> magazine, BERG, and Capital Radio.

Phil has over twenty yearsâ€™ experience of front- and back-end development, and has a good eye for design and usability; the user, not the code, comes first.

We often use Django (with or without Wagtail CMS), or WordPress, or whatever tools are right for the task. Our sites feature sensible HTML, CSS and JavaScript, keeping the experience as simple and speedy as possible. We enjoy visualising data with tools such as&nbsp;D3.js.
