Well-Formed was founded by [Phil Gyford](https://www.gyford.com/), who has been designing and building things on the internet since the mid-1990s. He has previously held positions at <cite>Wired</cite> magazine, BERG, and Capital Radio, and worked for clients such as the BBC, Channel 4, the <cite>Guardian</cite> and Google.

We tackle both front- and back-end development, and have a good eye for design and usability. We often use Django or WordPress on the back-end, when right for the task. Our sites feature sensible HTML, CSS and JavaScript, keeping the experience as simple and speedy as possible, and we enjoy visualising data with tools such as&nbsp;D3.js.
