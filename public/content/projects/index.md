        Working with Good, Form & Spectacle (GF&S), I built a site that explores 60 years of data for New York's Museum of Modern Art. It combines MoMA's data with more from Wikidata and the New York Times, and provides several visualisations (in D3.js) to provide overviews of the organisation and its work over the decades.

<h3><a href="http://wb.britishmuseum.org/">The Waddesdon Bequest</a></h3>

        Also with <abbr title="Good, Form & Spectacle">GF&S</abbr>, the Waddesdon Bequest site for the British Museum displays all the exhibits from one collection. This allows users to compare the objects and discover much more information about them.
