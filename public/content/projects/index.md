        <p>Working with <a href="http://goodformandspectacle.com">Good, Form & Spectacle</a> (GF&S), I built a site that explores 60 years of data for New York's Museum of Modern Art.</p>

        <p>It combines MoMA's data with more from Wikidata and the <cite>New York Times</cite>, and has several visualisations (using D3.js) providing overviews of the organisation and its work over the decades.</p>

        <p>Also with <a href="http://goodformandspectacle.com"><abbr title="Good, Form & Spectacle">GF&S</abbr></a>, the Waddesdon Bequest site for the British Museum displays all the exhibits from one collection.</p>

        <p>Users can compare the objects by size, weight, origin, year of acquisition, and more. Every object features information from the British Museum's archive and detailed zoomable photos.</p>
