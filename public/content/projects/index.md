Some of my most interesting projects from recent years:

<section class="grid grid--2-1">
    <div>
        <h3>
            <a href="http://spelunker.moma.org/">MoMA Exhibition Spelunker</a>
        </h3>
        <p>Working with <a href="http://goodformandspectacle.com">Good, Form & Spectacle</a> (GF&S), I built a site that explores 60 years of data for New York's Museum of Modern Art.</p>

        <p>It combines MoMA's data with more from Wikidata and the <cite>New York Times</cite>, and has several visualisations (using D3.js) providing overviews of the organisation and its work over the decades.</p>

<section class="grid grid--2-1">
    <div>
        <h3>
            <a href="http://wb.britishmuseum.org/">The Waddesdon Bequest</a>
        </h3>
        <p>Also with <a href="http://goodformandspectacle.com"><abbr title="Good, Form & Spectacle">GF&S</abbr></a>, the Waddesdon Bequest site for the British Museum displays all the exhibits from one collection.</p>

        <p>Users can compare the objects by size, weight, origin, year of acquisition, and more. Every object features information from the British Museum's archive and detailed zoomable photos.</p>

<section class="grid grid--2-1">
    <div>
        <h3>
            <a href="https://guardian.gyford.com/">Todayâ€™s Guardian</a>
        </h3>
        <p>A self-directed project from 2010, building a browsable online version of a newspaper, using the <cite>Guardian</cite>'s API. <a href="https://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2010/06/09/todays-guardian/">Read more about the design thinking</a>.</p>

        <p>This was later taken further in collaboration with BERG, funded by the <cite>Guardian</cite>, to create "a newspaper that looks back at you". <a href="http://berglondon.com/blog/2012/08/01/headliner/">Read more about it.</a></p>
